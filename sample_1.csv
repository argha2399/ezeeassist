This approach is not only enhancing the learning experience but also significantly boosting usage rates and ROI for franchisors., Hear more from Woven’s recent blog post:, , , The typical LMS works in isolation, often requiring separate logins and manual management by location managers. This traditional model results in low engagement after the initial onboarding, with frontline employees rarely using the system. However, in ways that ensure franchisees and their employees will see them every day, Woven’s integration means that training and development become a natural part of employees’ daily routines, dramatically increasing usage and engagement., , Woven’s platform does more than just host content; it makes learning a vital part of the franchise’s operational ecosystem. When new courses need to be taken or content updated, the integration ensures that frontline employees are immediately aware and engaged. This constant visibility means that learning is not a separate, forgettable task but a continuous, engaging process. The result is a significant increase in newly learned information and practices within the franchise, directly impacting the franchisor’s ROI., , , By moving away from the disconnected nature of traditional LMS solutions, franchises report not just improvements in employee performance and satisfaction but also in operational efficiency and cost savings. This improvement is a testament to Woven’s model, resulting in higher ROI for franchisors through increased engagement and training courses., , Check out Woven’s post here.

At this point, the brand was non-digital, with zero automation. Their daily workflow relied on manual efforts, which was no longer sustainable to reach their brand goals., After demoing seven different CRMs, the Mosquito Squad team chose to partner with serviceminder because it was the only solution that checked all their boxes:, One Mosquito Squad location can have 800+ appointments during busy season in one workday, averaging about 78 appointments across all locations. serviceminder has played a crucial role in increasing efficiency for all locations by streamlining dispatch and scheduling for service agents., As the industry evolves and new challenges arise, serviceminder continues to support Mosquito Squad with new functionalities and integrations.

Quick Data Without Breaking the Bank: Why a K9 Resorts Franchisee Uses Smappen for Expansion,"K9 Resorts is an award-winning luxury dog boarding and daycare franchise founded in 2005 with over 30 locations throughout the United States, including New York, […]",https://franchisesuppliernetwork.com/k9-resorts-smappen/,https://franchisesuppliernetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Resource-Banner-16-550x300.png," , K9 Resorts is an award-winning luxury dog boarding and daycare franchise founded in 2005 with over 30 locations throughout the United States, including New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Texas, Florida, and Arizona. They offer cage-free boarding, daycare services with group play, and more., Michael Dore runs MCD Associates LLC, a K9 Resorts multi-franchisee, currently operates two K9 Resorts locations in Texas and plans to grow to at least eight locations in that market and is looking to expand into other territories. As an operator, Michael’s day-to-day is all about taking care of the behind-the-scenes operations that keep the business growing., His mission:, As a franchisee with a growing business, Michael needed a way to research potential sites for new locations. Finding the perfect site involved multiple factors, including outdoor space for multiple dogs, proximity to habitual locations for his customers (like fast food joints and coffee shops), and demographics like high annual income. But while Michael’s commercial realtor provides sites, Michael likes to dig into the advanced data behind them himself to reduce the back and forth—which is why he went looking for a tool he could start using quickly with no learning curve., “We’re a smaller franchise group and we’re growing. We don’t have the funds to buy one of the huge location intelligence platforms and we don’t have the use for it since we don’t have a dedicated person to work on it. We need data where it’s quick and usable.”, While Michael gets a ton of support from his franchisor, he also likes to develop his own independent opinion in site selection. Since site research is just one of the many tasks he’s responsible for as an operator, meaning he likes to move quickly. That’s why Smappen is his location intelligence tool of choice., “My realtors or corporate may have some of the information I need, but I sometimes don’t want to wait for the time it takes them to give me my data. If I’m working on a project, I just want to work on it. Smappen is a tool where we can get quick information really easily.”, As Michael’s franchise grows, he’s looking for opportunities outside of Houston, both throughout Texas and in other states. As a Houston native working with a Houston realtor, he can get a ton of information about which neighborhoods he should set up shop in. But he needed a bit more help in other areas, and that’s why he turned to Smappen., “My realtor works with me in Houston, and he’s not going to work with me if I go to Boston, Chicago, or Denver. So I decided to test Smappen. I liked that it was a monthly membership, and you could just sign up and cancel whenever. I like Smappen and it’s been working well for us.”, Smappen has filled a slot as an end-to-end location research partner for Michael and his franchise by giving them access to demographics, point-of-interest data, and more. It’s not just affordability that’s made Smappen Michael’s tool of choice; it’s empowering him to jump in whenever he needs to and do some quick research with a simple UI and dynamic maps., “With Smappen, I just type in an address and I get demographics super quickly. I can look at households over a certain income, then start looking at radiuses to compare the demographics in a one-mile radius versus a five-mile radius.”, “A lot of location intelligence tools are too cost-prohibitive, and you often have to pay upfront. There’s definitely a larger barrier to entry with some of that data. Smappen is low-cost, it works, and it gives me the information I need. And when I’ve talked to the Smappen team about features I needed, they were rolled out within a couple of weeks.” – Michael Dore, K9 Resorts Franchisee, Get connected with Smappen here, Franchise Supplier Network is a community dedicated to helping franchisors and industry suppliers connect and grow.

Boulevard of Broker Dreams: Senate Bill 919 Explained,Premier franchise law firm Fisher Zucker is always keeping up to date with ever-changing franchise laws & regulations: California’s proposed Senate Bill No. 919 (“Bill […],https://franchisesuppliernetwork.com/senate-bill-919/,https://franchisesuppliernetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Resource-Banner-2-550x300.png," , Premier franchise law firm Fisher Zucker is always keeping up to date with ever-changing franchise laws & regulations:, California’s proposed Senate Bill No. 919 (“Bill 919”) is indicative of a growing trend in the franchising industry to increase the regulation of franchise brokers and to shift the compliance burden to the brokers themselves. Historically, franchise laws have focused on requiring affirmative disclosures by franchisors so that franchisee prospects can obtain information about the franchise system to better understand the business opportunity that they are evaluating. While the vast majority of franchise registration states require franchisors to submit information about their third-party brokers in franchise seller disclosure forms, only two (New York and Washington), have historically required brokers to register themselves with the state., If passed, Bill 919 would require third-party franchise sellers, colloquially known as franchise brokers, to register with the State of California. The fee for a franchise seller filing an initial registration application is $250, with a $150 annual renewal fee and $50 fee to amend a registration upon a material change to the application information. More notably, Bill 919 goes above and beyond the registration requirement, which is also found in New York and Washington law, by adding a disclosure component., Under Bill 919, franchise brokers would be required to disclose some of the information that is traditionally provided by franchisors in their Franchise Disclosure Document (“FDD”).  Specifically, brokers must submit a Uniform Third-Party Franchise Seller Disclosure Form and a Uniform Third-Party Franchise Seller Disclosure Document (“FSDD”) along with their registration application. In addition to registering the FSDD with the state, franchise sellers must also present this document to a prospective franchisee prior to engaging with them about a franchise opportunity., The FSDD must include the following information:, While not nearly as extensive as the FDD’s disclosure obligations, Bill 919’s FSDD tracks some of the types of items that must also be disclosed by franchisors, such as litigation history and fee structure., With respect to enforcement, Bill 919 creates a cause of action that allows franchisees to sue for damages and rescission if the seller violates the law with respect to a franchise sale. Additionally, the California commissioner can issue a stop order prohibiting a franchise seller from offering or selling franchises in the state if it finds that a seller has failed to comply with any applicable provisions of law or rules issued by the commissioner., The bill is not limited to sellers located in the State of California. The new rules and penalties will also to any scenario when a prospective franchisee is a resident of California, has its principal place of business in California, or if the franchised business is located in California; this essentially extends the scope of Bill 919 to any franchise broker that wishes to sell franchises that will be located in California or sell franchises to prospects located in California., Furthermore, as none of the mandatory disclosure items are limited to California sellers or California franchisees, it appears that Bill 919 may have a secondary purpose of creating a template for the regulation of franchise sellers on a nationwide level. Coupled with the fact that the International Franchise Association assisted in crafting this bill, we view Bill 919 as a bellwether of more regulation to come, either from additional registration states acting individually or through the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA). Sponsored by Senator Tom Umberg, Bill 919 is being considered by the Rules Committee and would go into effect July 1, 2025., Get connected with Fisher Zucker here!, Franchise Supplier Network is a community dedicated to helping franchisors and industry suppliers connect and grow.

Franchisees often own restoration companies, and buy a franchise territory to add emergency plumbing to their services., The initial location was founded in 2018 and started franchising in 2020; the franchise currently has 59 locations across the U.S., Vice President of 1 Tom Plumber, Angie Honeycutt is part of developing and tweaking the tried-and-true system they provide to franchisees—and giving them all the tools they need to succeed.  She also plays a key role in the success of the overall franchise, working closely with the sales team to maximize growth., Her mission:, When running a franchise, mapping software is essential for drawing franchise territories, researching the competition, and even just showing potential franchisees what their options are., Angie was already using mapping software before switching to Smappen, but it just wasn’t cutting it. While it was an industry leader, it was overly complex, dense, and far from intuitive. For a Vice President who already has a lot on her plate, software that takes extra time to figure out every time you need it—unless you reach out to customer support—won’t do., “I used [other software] for a couple of years. But every time I would go to draw a map, I would have to look up directions on how to do it. The support was great, but I couldn’t just click on the map and start drawing a territory like I can with Smappen.”, As a Vice President, Angie has to deal with a wide range of tasks in her day-to-day work. She’s helping the team refine the overall franchise model, onboarding new franchisees, and ensuring that existing franchisees have everything they need to reach their goals. Mapping franchise territories is just one of these tasks, and she doesn’t have any time to lose doing it. That’s why she chose Smappen., “We’re only mapping territories a few times a month. With our old software, it was complicated enough that I could just never remember how to do it. With Smappen, I’ve only reached out once or twice with questions. It’s just much easier to use from the get-go.”, Franchise territories should strike that perfect balance between meeting your franchise’s needs and giving franchisees the best chance to succeed. You can’t do that without data—and it needs a certain level of granularity. With Smappen, Angie gets exactly the data she needs., “We can map a territory and see all of that data. That helps us provide our franchisees with a lot more information about their territory.”, Franchise strategy doesn’t begin or end with mapping territories. Franchisees usually come to Angie with an idea of where they’d like to operate, but it’s up to 1 Tom Plumber to do the necessary research to give them a territory they’re most likely to succeed in. That involves POI (point of interest) data, which Smappen also delivers on., “Being able to search for anything is a nice feature. Since we’re a plumbing company, a lot of the places we target are restaurants or apartment buildings. You can put that in Smappen and easily get that information.”, “Smappen is very user-friendly. There’s so much data that you can pull from when you draw the maps, like population and business data. You can export everything for reporting and easily categorize your territories.” – Angie Honeycutt, Vice President at 1 Tom Plumber, Smappen is the quickest and easiest territory mapping software you’ve ever had 🤠, Get connected with Smappen here!, Franchise Supplier Network is a community dedicated to helping franchisors and industry suppliers connect and grow.

Is Private Equity for You?,"In today’s challenging lending environment, private equity can be a solution for franchises, especially in larger, established tier-one brands. C Squared Advisory Group, LLC is […]",https://franchisesuppliernetwork.com/private-equity-franchise/,https://franchisesuppliernetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Resource-Banner-10-550x300.png," , In today’s challenging lending environment, private equity can be a solution for franchises, especially in larger, established tier-one brands., C Squared Advisory Group, LLC is an independent investment bank providing financial and transaction advisory services to the restaurant, franchise, and multi-unit retail industries. As the most experienced and multi-skilled industry advisory firm, we assist in optimizing the financial performance of clients’ businesses, position clients to maximize the value of their businesses, while guiding our clients and managing the complex transactions to help achieve clients’ goals. Our long-term clients include multi-unit franchisees, franchisors, independent brands, family businesses, large corporations, investors, lenders, private equity investors and family offices., Check out this article by Carty Davis, a Squared Advisor, found in Franchise Update Media to learn more about private equity opportunities and if they’re the right model for your business., Even though the calendar has turned to 2024, many of the obstacles franchisees faced in the challenging deal environment of 2023 are still present. Potential buyers continue to be discouraged by rising costs, restricted access to capital, and elevated interest rates. Franchisees considering a sale must seriously contemplate if this is the right time to sell their franchised units., For companies that cannot wait for the macro-economic environment to improve, our advice is to get organized and proactive. Financial records, contracts, leases, and other financial documents must be in order. Know the challenges or weaknesses of the business and be prepared to offer options or solutions., Valuations will be lower than in previous years, and a transaction’s momentum will suffer if the buyer encounters unexpected difficulties or surprises during due diligence. In some cases, a quality of earnings (QofE) report may be helpful, with most independent brand transactions requiring one. Proactively completing a QofE report before going to market will often mitigate a purchase price adjustment or re-trade and accelerate the deal timetable., As part of the transaction, sellers should clearly outline planned and required future capital projects. For networks that have received deferrals or extensions on development or remodeling, the cost, timing, and scope of work should be detailed. In most cases, deferred maintenance and remodels that have not been completed will be a shared cost between buyer and seller. Projections that include proven sales increases have a greater likelihood of acceptance by a buyer., Details on historical sales improvements will also provide the buyer comfort that they are sustainable and not a one-time occurrence. Positive sales and EBITDA momentum is essential when selling in a challenging economic environment. If you don’t have a definite logical buyer, hire an advisory firm to manage the sale, minimizing distractions with the process while adding value and allowing the seller to focus on maintaining the performance of the business., With rapidly changing costs, interest rate swings, global political developments, and government intervention in franchising, completing transactions on an accelerated timeline has never been more important. Uncertainty and the abovementioned factors are contributing to more situations for something to go wrong than at any time in recent memory., To keep transactions on track, sellers should focus on preparation and relations with contracted parties. Solid relations and communication with landlords can save days or weeks in the closing process in terms of receiving timely consents and lease assignments. Open dialogue in terms of transaction timing can also minimize last-minute demands from landlords. Advanced communication with counsel to prepare initial forms of LOIs, purchase agreements, and other documents also can save sellers time., A wide gap in valuation expectations persists between sellers and buyers. Many sellers, especially those in the QSR space with drive-thrus, experienced strong financial results in 2020 and 2021 and continue to think they can sell based on those results. Buyers, however, are factoring in an additional 6 months of margin compression because of increases in commodities and labor costs., Thus, sellers contemplating deals today must be prepared to get creative to bridge the gap. With traditional capital sources constrained, to get deals done both buyers and sellers should review alternatives such as seller financing, non-bank lenders, earnouts, and rollover minority equity positions. We expect the valuation gap to remain unbalanced until margin pressures and interest rates are more predictable., While private equity can be a solution for franchises, especially in larger, established tier-one brands, most PE firms concentrate on owning brands, not on being a franchisee., PE firms, family offices, and other institutional capital will continue to selectively pursue new franchisee opportunities. In limited cases, turning to one of these investors may be the best option for franchisees, especially in growing, independent brands with scale. Family offices can be a better fit for franchisees as they often have a longer-term investment horizon with flexibility to invest in real estate as well as in operating businesses. PE firms generally have a defined investment horizon and are not interested in real estate., However, many brands are not interested in PE investments in their system. Before embarking on a sale to a PE firm, it is best to understand your brand’s thoughts on institutional capital. Brands vary on this issue; some restrict PE investments while others are more open to the idea., Selling to a PE firm or family office also can be an option for operators who may want to continue to be involved in the business without the pressure of full control. Often PE firms bring industry experience, back-office resources, and technology that can improve profitability. Synergies may be present in their existing portfolio, especially if the PE firm is a proven consolidator. Franchisees looking to partner with a PE firm must be prepared to have a laser focus on growth and investment returns., Franchisees that are successful dealmakers must adapt to different and evolving criteria as deal conditions remain less certain and fluid. Be patient, flexible, and look for fair solutions that can satisfy both parties. The deal environment is expected to be unpredictable for the foreseeable future, so consider adjusting your expectations to improve your chances of success., Carty Davis is a partner with C Squared Advisors, a boutique investment bank that has completed hundreds of transactions in the multi-unit franchise and restaurant space.

If they are juggling many different technologies to manage their operations, consider PocketSuite, an all-in-one platform., PocketSuite makes it easy to onboard new franchisees, manage existing locations and track performance. With your franchise system operating on one platform, you will have verified income data, roll up reporting and automatic royalty collections. All this and more are available in our industry-leading mobile app and desktop platform., Read a snippet of their Business Outlook below., If you are a fitness instructor, an esthetician, a dog groomer, or a home healthcare provider, 2023 was a good year and 2024 is looking to be even better. According to International Franchise Association (IFA) data, franchised establishments delivering personal services such as beauty, health & wellness, and pet services enjoyed the highest growth of any franchise business line in 2023. In fact, since the Pandemic growth in Personal Services’ establishments has far outpaced every other franchise industry sector. Employment growth has also greatly exceeded the industry, increasing 21% compared to industry growth of 16%., The outlook for 2024 and beyond looks favorable for Personal Services based on an assessment of economic, demographic and consumer indicators. Consumer Confidence January 2024 consumer confidence hit a 2-year high, according to the Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index. Increased consumer confidence translates to higher consumer discretionary spending for services such as Beauty and Health and Wellness., The US population is older today than it has ever been based on research by the Population Research Bureau (PRB). PRB forecasts that Americans aged 65 or older will increase almost 50% over the next 25 years compared to 11% growth in the overall population based on Congressional Budget Office statistics. An aging population presents the Personal Services industry with many avenues for growth including specialized Health and Wellness, Therapy, and Home Care services., The growing consensus among Wall Street economists is that the Federal Reserve’s credit tightening has come to an end. From its June 2022 peak of 9.1%, inflation has come down to an expected 3.1% in January 2024 and is forecast to trend down to 2.3% by Q3 2024 according to Trading Economics. This is good news for the Personal Services industry because consumers tend to rely upon credit cards or BNPL (Buy Now, Pay Later) financing to purchase personal services., Favorable economic and demographic trends, bolstered by improving consumer sentiment, create a land of opportunity for organic growth and emerging concept development in the Personal Services industry. The dramatic growth in recent years of salon suites, both franchise and corporate-owned concepts, is an example where commercial real estate investors have capitalized on consumer demand for Personal Services by renting “suites” to independent beauty Pros., What was an emerging business model 10 years ago is now a multi-billion-dollar industry. Today’s emerging concepts in the Personal Services industry include hydration bars, mobile gyms for people (and pets!), and elderly care businesses providing services such as helping the 11,000 baby boomers reaching retirement age every day downsize and simplify their lives.

They perform HVAC system assessments and optimization, insulation retrofits, air sealing, and more. Customers rave about the company’s speed, cleanliness, and attention to detail. Much of the work they do involves retrofitting insulation in 20 to 30-year-old homes., Dustin Ingle, CEO & Director of Franchise Development and his executive team started Insulation Commandos after working in the home services and franchise development sectors for years. They have successfully scaled multiple brands in the past and aim to grow Insulation Commandos to at least 10 locations in the next year., His mission:, As a franchisor, Dustin has a two-fold challenge: keeping his initial location growing while developing the franchise itself. That means building a fool-proof business strategy he can use as a model for future franchisees. That kind of work involves deep market research, careful franchise territory mapping, and optimized marketing efforts., “The software I was using was pretty outdated. It’s very basic. You click on a zip code and have to wait 10 seconds before it’s highlighted. It needs an update, and there are a lot of franchisors using it. They don’t even know Smappen exists.”, Properly researched and defined franchise territories can make or break a franchise. Unlike many franchisors who are still using outdated tools, Dustin can generate and share territories with franchisees dynamically with Smappen., “When I have a call with a potential franchisee, I can show them the map of their city in Smappen and we build the territories out together since the franchisees know the area better than we do. A franchisee in Austin purchased four territories, and we built those four territories with Smappen and put them right in the contract. ”, Smappen’s robust database gives Dustin the ability to properly research franchise territories, giving potential franchisees the best chance to succeed. But it’s also a great marketing tool, too, allowing Insulation Commandos to tailor their approach to each territory — like mailing flyers in areas where homeowners are more receptive to this strategy., “When franchisees see all that data, they’re like ‘Wow, this is a robust system.’ You can see where people in a territory work, how much money they’re making, the values of their homes, and even how many people live in that house. All that data is right there.”, As the CEO of Insulation Commandos, Dustin does a lot of traveling. He may be meeting potential franchisees, working with local teams, or otherwise developing the business. Location intelligence platforms he’s used in the past didn’t work while he was on the go — not the way Smappen does., “I travel a lot. I can pull Smappen up on my phone and literally build a territory in five seconds, whereas the previous software I used was definitely not mobile-friendly. You can’t even log in on your phone.”, “When Laurent connected with me and showed me a demo, I thought ‘Wow, this is 1000 times better than what I’m using now.’ I was working for a big franchise company at the time, and when I left to start Insulation Commandos, it was a no-brainer that I was going to use Smappen.”, “Smappen is very user-friendly mapping software that checks all the boxes for franchise development, where you’re building and managing territories. Its built-in data means you can also leverage it in marketing.” – Dustin Ingle, CEO at Insulation Commandos, Get connected with Smappen here!, Franchise Supplier Network is a community dedicated to helping franchisors and industry suppliers connect and grow.

In today’s […]",https://franchisesuppliernetwork.com/franchise-google-business/,https://franchisesuppliernetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Resource-Banner-29-550x300.png," , Purple Penguin Digital is a proven franchise marketing partner since 2009, delivering tangible results to its clients, with no contracts or hidden fees., In today’s ever-changing digital marketplace, where consumers turn to the internet for practically everything, establishing a robust online presence is a must-have for successful franchisors and franchisees alike. At the heart of this digital journey lies your Google Business Profile (GBP) and consistent directory listings. Imagine them as your virtual footprints and your digital business card, reaching potential customers even before you do. Let’s delve into why the accuracy and consistency of these components are essential and how they can shape your brand’s success., Your Google Business Profile is often the first impression customers have of your franchise business. It’s like a modern-day storefront, inviting people to step in. Keeping your GBP updated with accurate business information, such as your address, contact details, business hours, and a brief description, builds an immediate sense of trust. Customers appreciate reliability, and when they find consistent information across platforms, it reinforces your credibility. Moreover, accurate information plays a pivotal role in search engine algorithms, reducing the risk of being downgraded due to conflicting details., Think of consistent directory listings as a roadmap guiding potential customers to your business. When your franchise maintains uniform information across various online directories and platforms, you become easily discoverable. This means that regardless of where a customer searches for your services – whether it’s Google, Yelp, or industry-specific directories – they’ll find the same accurate information. This not only helps you tap into a wider audience but also increases the chances of your business appearing in organic local search results, where many purchase journeys begin., In the digital era, your online reputation is as significant as your physical word of mouth reputation. A well-managed Google Business Profile and consistent directory listings contribute to this reputation by projecting professionalism, reliability, and commitment to your customers. Positive reviews and ratings further bolster your image, acting as digital testimonials that influence consumer decisions. When you provide potential customers with a trustworthy and accurate online footprint, you attract new business and encourage repeat business from satisfied clients., In this ever-evolving digital landscape, the foundation of your franchise’s online success rests upon maintaining a precise and consistent online presence.

Why Your Franchise Needs an Independent Website: Navigating SEO & Digital Marketing in 2024 with DevHub,"In the ever-evolving digital landscape of 2024, the importance of a franchise’s website cannot be overstated. As the cornerstone of your Digital Activation Strategy (DAS) […]",https://franchisesuppliernetwork.com/franchise-seo-2024/,https://franchisesuppliernetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Resource-Banner-1-4-550x300.png," , In the ever-evolving digital landscape of 2024, the importance of a franchise’s website cannot be overstated. As the cornerstone of your Digital Activation Strategy (DAS) i.e. listings, review, social, paid, direct mail – to name a few, your website is not just a tool, but the heart of your online presence, the source of truth for customers and the digital front door for local marketing. Its role extends beyond being a mere digital brochure as might make you believe; it’s a dynamic platform that drives SEO, generates leads, and ultimately, contributes significantly to your franchisees’ revenue., Imagine your website as the central hub in a wheel, with every spoke representing different digital tools and platforms, from AI-driven solutions to online directories. It’s the foundation that supports and connects these technologies. In this context, a website that merely “checks the box,” as our CEO likes to say – is a missed opportunity. The goal is to create a solid foundation site that doesn’t just “check the box” but rather, sets new standards for agencies ensuring core web vitals are met, new pages can be added at a moment’s notice, a site can be launched for the new franchisee in minutes, and that budgets for advertising are being accounted for with new leads., The future of SEO will be significantly influenced by Google’s Search Generative Experience (SGE), an AI-powered search technology that’s reshaping the way users interact with search engines and how digital marketers approach SEO., At a recent conference attended by our CEO, an insightful concept was shared, emphasizing the efficiency of information that a brand already has access to; highlighting that merely 10% of a brand’s information can potentially address 80% of customer inquiries. This statistic underscores the importance of strategically organizing and presenting information, in a format easily read and sourced by LLMs (either in-house or through tools like ChatGPT or Google Bard), Having your structured content aligned with current conversational search trends not only makes information more accessible to customers but also caters to the evolving nature of search engine queries. Leveraging tools such as Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool can be instrumental in this process. This tool helps in identifying prevalent questions and long-tail queries relevant to your business domain, allowing you to tailor your content to meet specific customer needs and search patterns. By focusing on creating content that addresses these targeted queries, you can enhance the relevance and visibility of your brand’s online presence., While the roll-out of Google SGE (currently in beta) will mark a significant shift in SEO strategies, brands and their chosen platform and/or SEO professionals need to adapt by focusing on quality, informative content and aligning with the evolving user search behaviors driven by AI technologies like SGE and ChatGPT. The goal is to balance between optimizing for search engines and fulfilling user intent more effectively., Often, marketing agencies bundle website development with other DAS services, such as paid advertising. This approach can lead to websites being treated as an afterthought. In contrast, separating each component of your DAS allows for integrating the best marketing technologies, tailored to each specific need., Today, if you need to spin up an additional page or 40 for franchisees to offer a new service – how long would that take to execute? A day? Week? Month? Three? The opportunity may already have passed, such as the seasonality of hanging holiday lights or a specific type of pest for an exterminator., In the local marketing category of MarTech (marketing technology) startups are clamoring to add more products to their solutions to add more revenue to appease investors vs. customers. Whether you are 20 locations or 1,000 – everyone gets the same platform. No two businesses have the exact marketing tech stack, so while a lower price may seem appealing, you have to ask – what is missing that our franchisees really need today, tomorrow, and beyond?, Many agencies outsource website development, using white-labeled third-party services. This not only adds unnecessary costs but also complicates communication and collaboration, requiring an unwieldy amount of trust in multiple parties to work efficiently without significant oversight., Additionally, if your agency is running your paid search – they most likely are taking a fee – typically between 10 – 20% of your spend. So while your franchisees are shelling out $1000 only $800 is going to actual advertising – that could be an additional 6 – 12 new customers that are not seeing or choosing your franchisee., Staying current with Google guidelines and core web vitals is crucial for maintaining your site’s relevance and effectiveness. Additionally, compliance with standards like the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is not just a legal imperative but also a moral one. Failing to keep up can have significant repercussions., Consumer behavior is in a constant state of flux. The rise of mobile-first designs, user interfaces (UIs) focused on personalization, and localization are trends that can’t be ignored. While agencies can manage these changes, dedicated website vendors, who specialize exclusively in website development, are more likely to be proactive and efficient in implementing these updates., In conclusion, for franchise brands looking to radically change their approach and thrive in 2024 and beyond, it’s essential to keep franchisee websites independent from all-in-one platforms and agencies. By doing so, they can leverage the most effective marketing technologies, avoid unnecessary costs, ensure timely updates, and meet the evolving demands of consumers. An independent, well-maintained, and strategically developed website is not just a part of your digital strategy—it’s the linchpin of your franchisees’ success. Click here to learn more about making the most of your franchise website in 2024., Original publishing here., Get connected with DevHub here!, Franchise Supplier Network is a community dedicated to helping franchisors and industry suppliers connect and grow.

Yet, as […]",https://franchisesuppliernetwork.com/local-franchise-digital-marketing/,https://franchisesuppliernetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Resource-Banner-15-550x300.png," , The franchise model remains a beacon of entrepreneurial spirit, merging the safety of a proven business model with the excitement of individual ownership. Yet, as the landscape becomes increasingly competitive, standing out in the franchise market is no small feat. It’s not just about a solid business plan anymore; it’s about how you can enhance franchise offering to make it more attractive and lucrative for potential franchisees., Enter the dynamic duo of Evocalize and local digital marketing – a game-changing combination that’s redefining the attractiveness of franchise opportunities., In this article, we’ll dive into the nuts and bolts of why robust and localized digital marketing strategies are no longer just a ‘good-to-have’, but a ‘must-have’ in enhancing your franchise offerings. It’s about creating a harmonious blend of global branding and local relevance – a strategy that not only resonates with potential franchise owners but also with the end consumers they aim to attract.,  , In the bustling marketplace of franchise opportunities, what sets a franchise apart isn’t just its business model or brand recognition; it’s the overall attractiveness of its offering to potential franchisees. This attractiveness hinges on a multitude of factors, from financial return and growth potential to support systems and marketing prowess., Let’s face it, when someone decides to invest in a franchise, they’re not just buying into a business; they’re buying into a dream – a dream of success, independence, and growth. This dream becomes more tangible when they can see the real value behind what’s being offered. The key to enhance franchise offering? A well-orchestrated digital marketing strategy that connects with the local community, yet ties back to the strength of a well-known brand., In today’s digital-first world, the ability of a franchise to offer comprehensive and localized marketing support is more than an added bonus. Prospective franchisees are increasingly savvy about the need for a strong digital presence, one that reaches the right audience with the right message at the right time. They are looking for evidence that the franchisor understands not only the broad strokes of marketing but also the nuances of local engagement., Why? Because local engagement drives business. A staggering 88% of local searches on a mobile device results in a visit to the business or a phone call within 24 hours., A franchise that excels in resonating with its local community stands a higher chance of success. Potential franchisees know this. They are on the lookout for franchisors who offer not just a name and a product, but a path to forging meaningful connections with local customers. This is where the real magic to enhance franchise offering lies.,  , While the franchise model offers numerous advantages, it comes with its own set of complexities, many of which center around maintaining brand consistency and effectively managing local marketing efforts., Understanding the dual nature of franchise marketing, The first hurdle to enhance franchise offering is understanding and managing the dual nature of franchise marketing. On one hand, there’s a need to uphold the franchisor’s brand identity and values across all locations. This uniformity is what gives the franchise its strength and recognition. On the other hand, each franchisee operates in a unique local market with its own preferences and competitors. Herein lies the challenge: How does one maintain this delicate balance between global brand consistency and local market relevance?, Localization vs. brand consistency, A common pitfall for many franchises is either leaning too much towards centralization, thus stifling local innovation and relevance, or allowing too much localization, leading to a diluted or inconsistent brand image. Potential franchisees are often wary of these extremes. They seek a franchise that offers the support and strength of a well-established brand, yet allows enough flexibility to adapt and thrive in their local markets. To enhance franchise offering, therefore, means finding the sweet spot where brand consistency harmonizes with local customization., This is where the role of digital marketing, particularly local digital marketing, becomes pivotal. Traditional marketing methods often fall short in addressing these unique challenges. However, digital marketing, with its inherent flexibility and capacity for personalization, presents an opportunity to enhance franchise offering significantly., A sophisticated digital marketing strategy, empowered by platforms like Evocalize, can help franchises deploy localized campaigns that resonate with local audiences while ensuring that all marketing efforts align with the overarching brand message.

How Does TV Advertising Work?

As […]",https://franchisesuppliernetwork.com/awarity-tv-advertising/,https://franchisesuppliernetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Resource-Banner-15-550x300.png," , Awarity is an AI-powered advertising platform that helps brands reach their ideal customers more efficiently than other forms of awareness advertising, driving industry-leading ROI., As viewership has shifted to Connected TV, so have many advertisers. Learn how traditional and Connected TV advertising work to evaluate the right choice for your franchise., With the rise of streaming TV, more and more consumers have made the switch from cable to Connected TV, driving advertisers to shift towards these platforms to reach them. However, traditional TV advertising still plays a role in the marketing strategies of many brands. Developing an understanding of how both forms of media work is critical for any franchisor or franchisee looking to utilize TV advertising., So how does TV advertising work? Let’s review some of the basics behind how traditional and Connected TV advertising work and how they stack up against each other so you can determine the best choice for your brand., Traditional TV advertising can require a considerable amount of planning, budgeting, and research to get started. To run commercials on traditional TV, advertisers buy ad space during a specific program and specific time slot depending on their target audience. For example, a brand looking to reach working moms may buy ad space in late night TV time slots on reality TV programming with high female viewership rates., Connected TV advertising campaigns are significantly easier to get started. Connected TV reaches a more targeted audience than Traditional TV, as brands can choose specific audiences to reach on whatever program they’re watching. For example, the same brand looking to reach working moms could target that audience using behavioral and demographic tactics and serve commercials to them on any program, app, or channel they’re watching., Reporting and Measurement: Traditional TV’s reporting and metrics are limited, often relying on limited viewership data provided by networks. Alternatively, Connected TV campaigns provide access to real-time data so you can gain insights on the platforms your audience is watching, completion rates, impressions, and more. At Awarity, all Connected TV campaigns include access to Awarity Campaign Central, where you can access granular, real-time reporting., Creative Flexibility: Connected TV provides more flexibility to adjust and update your creative. With the ability to manage your own creative, you can easily feature specific promotions or tailor your creative based on the particular audience and individual franchise location. When it comes to Traditional TV, creative adjustments and customizations can be time consuming and require more communication with the networks., Pricing and Efficiency: At Awarity, our Connected TV campaigns have an avg. CPM of $35.85. While Traditional TV advertising’s CPMs vary by network, daypart, program, and other factors, its lack of targeting and skippable placements results in wasted ad spend and higher costs. When accounting for wasted media, Connected TV’s effective CPM to reach your target customer is much lower than traditional TV’s effective CPM., While Connected TV has increased in popularity for its ease of use, targeting capabilities, and reporting, traditional TV can still play a role for larger franchisors and brands looking to reach a broad audience. Understanding how tv advertising works and how different forms of linear and Connected TV can be implemented for the best results in your marketing strategy is a key first step to starting TV advertising., If you’re interested in seeing how Connected TV could fit into your marketing efforts, learn more and contact us here!, Here are some examples of CTV commercials that Awarity created and deployed for our clients: Connected TV Samples (awarity.com), Get connected with Awarity here!, Franchise Supplier Network is a community dedicated to helping franchisors and industry suppliers connect and grow.

Automate Your Customer Loyalty: How to Leverage AI for Your Business,While businesses may feel that using AI to interact with real-live customers may disconnect them from a loyal customer base: the opposite is in fact […],https://franchisesuppliernetwork.com/automated-customer-loyalty/,https://franchisesuppliernetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Resource-Banner-13-550x300.png," , While businesses may feel that using AI to interact with real-live customers may disconnect them from a loyal customer base: the opposite is in fact true. AI augments the work done by customer service professionals further encouraging positive interactions between the business and current, and future, customers., The 2023 State of AI Survey revealed some powerful statistics: 79% of customer service professionals view AI as a core part of their overall strategy, and 62% of those polled agreed that AI helped them interact with customers in a more effective and better way., When businesses begin to dive into their AI journey, it may be overwhelming to know where to start or how it can help their business to go to the next level. Below, dbSeer provides a few examples on where you might want to start for your business, and why., AI can be your customer, and your employee can practice pitching their calls until they’re perfect. AI-simulated customer experiences can provide valuable training for employees that will serve them in real time. Conversational AI is able to provide context in which the customer service personnel can practice and get experience finding solutions. AI solutions are also able to provide ideas and automated scripts for agents to use if they need them. In certain cases, using AI for training reduced onboarding time by 30%., AI models have been built to provide “next steps” for agents that are engaging with customers in real time. This helps streamline the process and create an efficient exchange with customer engagement. On the employee side, personalized recommendations will continue on-the-job learning and efficiency to handle issues., For customers, AI can learn from past histories, and generate personalized recommendations based on what the customer is requesting. Further encouraging a personalized experience in engaging with a business., AI can directly engage with the customers and interact back and forth in real time. Basic requests that make up 70-80% of the calls or messages for customer representative personnel can now be quickly answered with AI, this frees up time for the employees to focus their energy on more complicated customer questions, thereby better serving your business. AI can go even further with sentiment analysis able to detect a caller’s mood and ensure customer satisfaction., At dbSeer, we’ve worked with clients to show them the power of AI for their customer service. In a recent project with our B2C client, we looked at their needs and assessed that managing Google Reviews was a place that could be automated for their company. Managing a growing number of reviews can be an overwhelming task for businesses. And yet, businesses that respond to just a single customer review earn 4% more revenue on average, making it a clear priority for return on investment., In this specific case, our team at dbSeer successfully processed around 500 Google reviews, gaining valuable insights to help move our client forward. For example, for one of the comments, our AI model discerned that a review was made during a particularly cold November. This insight allowed us to craft a response that demonstrated our commitment to customer satisfaction during this season: truly providing a very personalized response to a cherished customer., This is the new way to work: your company will hit next-level success by implementing the power of automation and artificial intelligence. One company reported cutting 36 seconds off an average call with AI- just by ensuring calls went to the right department. This simple decision multiplied their productivity to thousands of calls per year. Nearly two-thirds of business owners believe AI will improve customer relationships: start using AI today to engage with your customers. dbSeer can help your company navigate the world of AI, reach out with an inquiry today., dbSeer is a leading data analytics provider offering cutting-edge services to extract valuable insights from your data and drive growth. With experienced data scientists and industry insights, we empower businesses to make informed decisions and achieve lasting impact.

This demographic of users like snippets to cater to their short attention spans., What’s the best way to retarget them?, A: Take advantage of SwipeUp Remarketing. Once they’ve swiped on your ad the first time, you’ve planted the seed. SwipeUp Remarketing allows you to catch their attention further down the funnel., How long should my campaign be? , A: Snapchat uses AI to target your audience. Every time you start a new campaign, it has to relearn the parameters. Therefore, the most effective campaigns are continual. The longer they run, the more data it collects, making them more effective. Simply change the ad sets frequently while keeping the original campaign running., Jessica says, “Advertising on Snapchat will cost an average of one-tenth what you’ll pay on Facebook per 1000 impressions. That means you’ll have a much wider reach for the same amount of ad spend.”, Snapchat users are an active bunch, spending on average 30 minutes a day on this social platform. Reaching this unique, highly diverse group of users is easy.

This playbook can make 2024 your best year ever!, For years in our franchise organization, our annual plan looked something like this:, Look familiar?, After years of rolling out these complex change-management initiatives, we realized they were:, It was killing profitability., Because in franchise, the winning formula is performance = people + process, No fancy HR tech or communication platform can make up for that., For clarity, “the process” is shorthand for the operating standards and customer touchpoints that that are unique to the brand and critical to the customer experience., Here’s the framework:, I’ll break the first two down further:, Just because employees learned “the process” in new hire training doesn’t mean they still follow it., Have each manager meet with their employees in early January to set the expectation that everyone will follow “the process” exactly as the franchisor trains. Then the manager observes “the process” in action to verify compliance., For example,, Based exclusively on these observations, managers rate each employee on an A-B-C player scale:, A-players quit if C-players aren’t held accountable by the manager, but 65% of managers say they don’t properly address their C-players., So, Regional managers and senior leaders need to observe unit-level managers while they coach their employees, including 1-on1s and reviews., Not all managers are capable of leading a process-oriented team. Some managers cannot make the transition., That’s ok – replacing them makes performance, morale and profit go up immediately., People + process must be addressed first if you want strong YOY growth., If you’re the type of operator who believes that store teams should only be accountable for their numbers, regardless of HOW they do it, you should sell your business. Or prepare to be endlessly frustrated by inconsistent performance, high turnover, and declining profit., You might be thinking “our people do follow the process”, but if you have underperforming locations, I guarantee you they’re not. Don’t take my word for it – just go observe them in action, and you’ll quickly see that “the process” as defined by the franchisor is virtually unrecognizable. And when you see that, smile – you now have a clear path to vastly improved profitability, To be clear, this effort is simple but not easy., Galvanizing teams around “the process” and finding high-performing managers takes commitment and investment. But if you see it through, you’ll LOVE the way your P&L looks. The best operators and managers understand that in franchise, performance = people + process., These insights are proudly NOT written by ChatGPT. #franchise, Get connected with Epic Managers here!, Download the Playbook Here, Franchise Supplier Network is a community dedicated to helping franchisors and industry suppliers connect and grow.

Embracing the New Norms of Franchisor-Franchisee Relations,C Squared Advisors is a boutique investment bank that has completed hundreds of transactions in the multi-unit franchise and restaurant space. C Squared Advisory Group […],https://franchisesuppliernetwork.com/franchisor-franchisee-relations/,https://franchisesuppliernetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Resource-Banner-7-550x300.png," , C Squared Advisors is a boutique investment bank that has completed hundreds of transactions in the multi-unit franchise and restaurant space. C Squared Advisory Group is an independent investment bank providing financial and transaction advisory services to the restaurant, franchise, and multi-unit retail industries., As an experienced and multi-skilled industry advisory firm, they assist in optimizing the financial performance of clients’ businesses, position clients to maximize the value of their businesses, while guiding their clients and managing the complex transactions to help achieve clients’ goals. Their long-term clients include multi-unit franchisees, franchisors, independent brands, family businesses, large corporations, investors, lenders, private equity investors and family offices., C Squared Advisors Principal Carty Davis penned an article for Franchise Update Media about the ever-changing relationship between franchisees and franchisors., Keep reading or click here for the full article.,  ,  , As the post-pandemic operating environment continues to evolve, both franchisors and franchisees are having to continually adapt their business models to manage through the changes that have affected all multi-unit businesses over the past several years., Franchise brands and operators today are facing new challenges related to inflation and increases in commodity costs, staffing issues, strained supply chains limiting the availability of certain products, and construction challenges related to the price of raw materials and the availability of labor and equipment needed to meet new development and remodel goals., Given these challenges, franchisor and franchisee relations have also continued to evolve. Brands have become more selective in approving new franchisees and are more involved in franchisee-to-franchisee transfers and acquisitions. To continue to grow in the franchise space, it is important for franchisees to review their growth plans and strategies to ensure alignment with franchisor goals and objectives., Successful growth within brands depends on a strong and healthy relationship between franchisors and franchisees. As more franchisees expand and diversify into multiple concepts, franchisor-franchisee relationships become more complicated. To foster a working relationship that is a win-win for all parties, it is important for franchisees to understand each franchisor’s goals, priorities, and concerns., The performance of specific brands has deviated significantly throughout the pandemic. Different brands have different focuses, and franchisee growth strategies should be tailored to best align with the current objectives of each franchisor. Alignment between each brand’s priorities and goals and franchisee support for those goals is critical to a successful relationship., As an example, many top-performing brands would likely respond more favorably to a franchisee looking to consolidate and acquire more units if that franchisee was also committed to future growth and development and reinvestment in their current portfolio. On the other hand, a challenged brand may be more supportive of a franchisee willing to acquire and turn around underperforming locations, putting that franchisee first in line for additional acquisition opportunities that arise. Brands are more willing to support franchisees who are willing to assist them in solving problems or are willing to become early adopters of brand initiatives, including remodeling and other key projects., Be transparent in their communication with franchisors on their growth plans, accomplishments, and financial strength. Many franchisees assume the franchisor is aware of everything transpiring in their businesses. As brands have streamlined internal support and G&A budgets have been cut, franchisors simply do not have the resources to track the activity of individual franchisees at the same level as in years past., Provide periodic updates on new development, remodeling, and their progress on other initiatives. This will ensure the brand is aware of a franchisee’s accomplishments, as well as any challenges they may come across., Plan a periodic face-to-face meeting with brand leadership to reinforce their financial capabilities, capital resources, and growth plans. These meetings can also serve as an opportunity for franchisees to position themselves as a resource and steward for the brand., Get involved with brand committees, advisory boards, and other groups focused on various aspects of the franchise business. Franchisee advisory committees often have more exposure to high-level executives and key members of a brand’s management team. Additionally, these committees allow franchisees to share best practices and learn from other high-profile and influential franchisees on how to better run and manage their businesses. The more visible a franchisee is to a brand and its leadership team, the more opportunities that operator will have to showcase their strengths and accomplishments to improve and gain additional support and favor with the brand., The relationship between franchisors and franchisees is continuously changing. The days of growing your franchise business without support and involvement from the franchisor are over. The most successful growth-oriented franchisees today are embracing interaction with the brand and supporting brand initiatives relating to discounting and promotions, new marketing campaigns, product tests, and reinvestment. Those most successful at increasing their respective profiles are able to gain easier brand support and approval on future acquisitions, and may even see additional acquisition opportunities steered their way., Our advice for growth-oriented franchisees is to develop a strong working relationship with your franchisors, and to come up with a plan to continue to enhance and improve those relationships. Let your franchisor know your goals and objectives, because without brand support, growth can be infinitely more difficult and unpredictable. As franchisors continue to exert increasing influence on the direction and growth of their franchise systems, it has never been more important to embrace the new norms of franchisor-franchisee relations., Get Connected with C Squared Advisors here!, Franchise Supplier Network is a community dedicated to helping franchisors and industry suppliers connect and grow.

Cabinet IQ is a high-tech cabinet and countertop home services franchise that prides itself on providing a five-star customer experience., Read below for how ServiceMinder helped them grow!, In September of 2022, Cabinet IQ met the ServiceMinder team at the Springboard Emerging and Re-emerging Franchisor Conference. Following this encounter, Cabinet IQ successfully concluded their six-month-long quest for a suitable CRM solution. Having experienced disappointment with three previous CRM options, primarily due to integration conflicts, inadequate scheduling features, and the unmanageable use of five different solutions, Cabinet IQ had identified precisely what they sought in a CRM. Their previous frustrations with other vendors had equipped them with a checklist of requirements that we were able to fulfill!, ”As an emerging brand, we still don’t know everything about the franchising space yet. ServiceMinder was able to solve problems we didn’t even know we had!” – Jacob Collums (VP of Franchise & Development), Despite having a well-defined vision of the necessary features, as an emerging brand, they were pleasantly surprised that ServiceMinder applied industry insights as a strategic partner rather than just another vendor. In November of 2022, Cabinet IQ officially partnered with ServiceMinder. With ServiceMinder’s comprehensive approach, Cabinet IQ transitioned from managing daily operations across five distinct platforms to a single, unified solution. After thorough training and workflow configuration, all locations were launched by August 2023. Less than a year into their ServiceMinder journey, Cabinet IQ launched two new locations., The team is looking forward to utilizing automation both internally and client-facing to enhance the client experience. Cabinet IQ is eager to share ServiceMinder with future franchisees., Franchise Supplier Network is a community dedicated to helping franchisors and industry suppliers connect and grow.

Woven Helps Planet Fitness Strengthen Member Experience,"Woven is the premier multi-unit business management platform for franchisee and independent owners, enabling them to manage people, operations and locations from one seamless platform. […]",https://franchisesuppliernetwork.com/woven-planet-fitness-case-study/,https://franchisesuppliernetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Resource-Banner-2-1-550x300.png," , Woven is the premier multi-unit business management platform for franchisee and independent owners, enabling them to manage people, operations and locations from one seamless platform. See below how the platform is pumping up franchise performance for Glow Brands’ Planet Fitness® Clubs to save time & strengthen member experience through consolidated communication and policy management., Going to the gym can be intimidating, even if you are not new to exercise. Kueber Fitness is a franchisee of Planet Fitness and operates 40 Planet Fitness clubs.  Planet Fitness strives to provide an environment where anyone can be comfortable. Planet Fitness is one of the largest and fastest-growing fitness center franchisors and operators in the United States. With its Judgement Free Zone®, the brand hopes to enhance people’s lives and create a healthier world by advancing physical, emotional and planet health. Fulfilling its mission requires clean and safe facilities and well-trained employees., The brand has seen exponential growth over the last few years — franchisee Glow Brands broke revenue and membership records at its 40 locations in 2022.  With more people going to the gym, the fitness clubs are under more pressure to provide consistent and quality client service to every member. Planet Fitness clubs were Glow Brands’ first brand to adopt Woven, consolidating administrative functions to enhance focus on customer experience with Woven saving Glow Brands more than a quarter million dollars per year across its Planet Fitness clubs., Like many companies, Glow Brands’ Planet Fitness clubs had many systems for essential functions. Employees accessed one portal for documents and received additional information via email, not to mention physical papers. Staff also used a franchise management website and a separate platform to report maintenance issues. Audits required two points of entry — a website and a spreadsheet., The time employees spent jumping between different programs could be used more productively for working with members, cleaning, and other essential tasks. Additionally, reporting and auditing were tedious and sometimes even outdated. Because of this, opportunities for improvement may have gone unidentified, and some issues required extended time to resolve., Communicating new policies required a game of telephone. Corporate would relay a message or policy change to general managers, who would be responsible for passing the information down the chain of command. This manual system created openings for delayed notification or even dropped communication., Glow Brands turned to Woven for a solution to its administrative platform sprawl in 2018. Woven worked with Glow Brands to create a solution combining all functions into a single location. Employees could access and acknowledge policies, manage, and monitor audits, file maintenance requests and work orders, and run reports without switching programs., Woven removes the middleman in communication. Managers no longer need to pass down information — everyone receives it through Woven at the same time. The platform also gives managers more control over their policies with the ability to adjust and distribute in the same place., Woven removes the middleman in communication. Managers no longer need to pass down information — everyone receives it through Woven at the same time. The platform also gives managers more control over their policies with the ability to adjust and distribute in the same place., “I can send messages to every single employee within Planet Fitness in the amount of time it takes me to upload the policy and click send. This is a big win for both managers and employees,” said Smith., With this streamlined communication, employees are better prepared for emergencies and remain updated on best practices., Easy-to-access maintenance and work order entry led to faster repairs. With a simple and intuitive interface, employees can quickly relay problems and even upload pictures. The maintenance staff can then provide instructions, order parts, and schedule technicians when necessary, and Woven keeps the lines of communication open for follow-ups., Woven’s audit feature makes general manager checklists easier to complete and send to required parties, leading to better productivity and follow-up in clubs. Executives can quickly access reports to check audit completion and identify recurring issues and successes., Glow Brands is conducting a tiered rollout of Woven’s scheduling function to its Planet Fitness clubs. Rather than creating schedules with worksheets and time off requests, managers can access all information in one place and automate much of the process. As soon as the schedule is done, Woven sends it out to all the employees, helping to remove issues related to people not seeing a posted paper schedule. Woven is currently working with Glow Brands to adjust its scheduling software to work with Planet Fitness’s unique 24-hour-a-day operations. Clubs already testing the feature report success., Industry: Health and Fitness, Locations: 40, Employees: ~600, Use Cases: Communication, knowledge management, policy management, executive reporting, location audits, work orders, incident reporting., Products Used: Woven, Key Results:, Key Discoveries:, Get connected with Woven here, Franchise Supplier Network is a community dedicated to helping franchisors and industry suppliers connect and grow.

Why Your Franchise Brand Needs A Franchise Marketing Operating System,"When an entrepreneur chooses to buy a franchise instead of simply starting their own business concept from scratch, they choose the franchise route for a […]",https://franchisesuppliernetwork.com/franchise-marketing-operating-system/,https://franchisesuppliernetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Resource-Banner-1-5-550x300.png," , When an entrepreneur chooses to buy a franchise instead of simply starting their own business concept from scratch, they choose the franchise route for a number of reasons. A proven business model, franchisor provided training and support and developed technologies that are already in place, are some of the benefits that come with buying a franchise., An often overlooked, yet essential part of developed technologies and that is expected of you by your franchisees, is digital marketing. Perhaps it is because many franchisors aren’t very knowledgeable about it themselves, don’t realize the importance of it, may have tried a number of different things that had poor results, or they haven’t been able to find a solution for digital marketing that addresses all the challenges they face, but, it seems that too often, digital marketing gets pushed to the wayside, which isn’t a good idea., A franchise brand’s online presence is something that cannot be ignored and must be addressed in a scalable and repeatable fashion just like the rest of a franchise system. Franchisors have to deliver on the promise made to franchisees to offer a mature, proven and fully developed marketing system in return for their investment., However, most franchisors fall short of this. They lack a Franchise Marketing Operating System., Read the full article here, SeoSamba’s Franchise Marketing Operation System, or FMOS, enables franchisors, multi-unit, and single unit franchisees to manage SEO, social media, performance and content marketing efforts across any number of territories, locations, websites from a single cloud-based interface while empowering local management., Get connected with SeoSamba here!, Franchise Supplier Network is a community dedicated to helping franchisors and industry suppliers connect and grow.

How To Target Home Service Leads With Ease,"Upon its founding in 2013, serviceminder had one mission in mind: to help home service (and commercial service) franchise businesses acquire and convert more leads, […]",https://franchisesuppliernetwork.com/home-service-leads/,https://franchisesuppliernetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Resource-Banner-15-550x300.png," , Upon its founding in 2013, serviceminder had one mission in mind: to help home service (and commercial service) franchise businesses acquire and convert more leads, schedule more appointments, close more deals and communicate with clients more effectively., It began with a world-class CRM built for field service with mapping, automated scheduling and dispatch. Then they added best-in-breed proposal writing with support for options, online deposits and payments, electronic signatures and reporting. Next, they perfected integrated email marketing and automation tools, fleet routing, integrated two-way texting, mapping and campaign budgeting enabling teams to measure revenue from campaigns and track cost per lead and revenue per client at the location and brand level. Oh, and dialed in reporting and analytics so locations and brands can better manage and grow., As IFA suppliers to home services franchises for over 10 years, serviceminder has perfected the recipe for targeting leads without doing any heavy lifting or digging. AKA simplifying and automating marketing efforts by utilizing scheduling and contact information., They don’t provide an “all-in-one” solution just because they’re tech nerds, they streamline home service brands’ entire workflow to save them time and money. Not only can it be overwhelming and confusing at scale to rely on several different platforms for business needs, but it can also be expensive., Here’s how the platform for managing and operating home services franchises allows your brand to be consistent and intentional when targeting leads without adding extra steps to daily workflow., serviceminder offers a shiny but unoriginally named feature called GeoZones. GeoZones can be used to increase productivity for service agents and also support marketing efforts. As a serviceminder admin, you can customize geo-zones based on zip code, city, or whatever you can draw out on a map – literally whatever your heart desires. (well, maybe not whatever, but you get the gist)., This feature improves productivity by scheduling appointments based on geography so service agents aren’t wasting too much time driving in the vans by crossing major highways driving around landscape elements like rivers, lakes and mountains! If the job or project happens to be outside, you can also measure the property and provide additional info to service agents before they even arrive. This capability ultimately improves client experience by prepping service agents and also saves a brand time and money at scale., But wait, there’s more… you can also send promo emails, direct mail, and local advertisement based on the data provided from using GeoZones-to both prospects and current clients. See a lot of opportunities in a certain GeoZone? Let’s target that area!, With their comprehensive approach, it’s ServiceMinder’s goal to provide multi-purpose features. Utilizing one ServiceMinder solution solves several challenges for home services brand., Another easy way to target clients for additional services or prospects is with Tags., As they appreciate that every workflow and home service brand is unique, like GeoZones, Tags are also completely customizable. You can create tags for types of service, lead type, client interests or whatever supports your marketing goals., With these Tags, you can create drip campaigns within serviceminder to automatically send an email or text with certain actions or scheduled at specific times to a specific targeted audience. There are many benefits to what we just mentioned, but the keyword is ‘automatically’. Once campaigns are created, there is no need to worry about chasing a lead or client retention. Your comprehensive CRM has you covered. This handy tool also helps to track client journey and campaign success, which again is all in serviceminder. Be in the know on marketing spend/ROI, popular service types, and more!, Not to be repetitive, but imagine streamlining all marketing efforts straight from your CRM? We know the term “all-in-one” is over-used, but in serviceminder’s case, it’s a perfect way to describe their solution., To see how they can eliminate daily hurdles for your brand, connect with serviceminder here!, Franchise Supplier Network is a community dedicated to helping franchisors and industry suppliers connect and grow.

FisherZucker Joint Employer Update: NLRBeef with Franchising,"On October 27, 2023, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) published a rule establishing a new standard for determining whether entities will be considered “joint […]",https://franchisesuppliernetwork.com/fisherzucker-joint-employer-update-nlrbeef-with-franchising/,https://franchisesuppliernetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Resource-Banner-1-3-550x300.png," , On October 27, 2023, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) published a rule establishing a new standard for determining whether entities will be considered “joint employers” of a group of employees for collective bargaining purposes. This rule essentially overturns the previous NLRB rule that took effect in April 2020. A one-page document summarizing the new rule and the recommended actions for franchise systems can be found here., While well-intentioned, the new rule threatens a key tenet of the franchising model and creates a number of unintended negative consequences for franchisors, franchisees and consumers. To that end, the International Franchising Association (IFA) and other industry groups submitted comments and requested some sort of carveout or additional clarification to protect the franchise model, but the NLRB declined. Therefore, unless Congress overturns this rule, we will be left with a new standard that is broader and more confusing than the “substantial direct and immediate control” required under the 2020 rule., In short, the franchise relationship is already highly regulated by the federal government, specifically the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), as well as by a number of states. This regulatory framework protects franchisees while solidifying their status as independent business owners that operate within a franchise system but are ultimately responsible for the success of their business through their management of employees and day-to-day operations. By introducing a new rule that undeniably increases the chances of determining that a franchisor will be considered the employer of their franchisees and/or their employees, the NLRB has introduced a totally separate and often contradictory lens within which the franchise relationship must be analyzed., As described below, the new NLRB rule prevents franchisors from establishing reasonable controls in two critical areas unless they are willing to risk being deemed an employer of their franchisees and/or their employees: (1) ensuring brand uniformity and enforcing minimum system standards, and (2) monitoring and managing franchisee compliance with industry-specific laws, regulations, and licensing requirements., Under the 2023 rule, an entity will be deemed to be a joint employer for purposes of collective bargaining if it has authority to control “essential terms and conditions of employment.” One of the positive impacts that came out of the NLRB’s comment period is that the proposed rule was modified to specifically list the seven terms and conditions that meet this threshold and affirmatively stating that the object of control must be tied to one of these seven terms. The seven terms are as follows:, Of these seven terms, four of them (#1, #2, #3, and #6) represent standard employer functions that should not impact the vast majority of franchise systems unless they are interpreted very liberally by the courts. Another term, the supervision of the performance of duties (#4), should also not pose a major problem unless this impacts a franchisor’s reserved rights to inspect and audit its franchisees, which is critical to ensuring brand standards are met. However, the final two terms and conditions of employment (#5 and #7) pose challenges under the new rule., Most franchise agreements require franchisees to comply with brand standards set forth in the franchise agreement and operations manual, which often include requirements related to health and safety. Additionally, the vast majority of franchise agreements require franchisees to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including laws related to health and safety, and permit the franchisor to terminate the franchise agreement if these obligations are breached. Under the new rule, these requirements trigger exposure to joint employment determinations, as franchisors are effectively prohibited from indirectly controlling or even reserving the right to control working conditions related to health and safety., Through this element, the NLRB has created a framework that harms not only franchise systems but also consumers. Franchisors are often better positioned than their franchisees to understand how to proactively develop policies and operational procedures to minimize health and safety risks to the public. They also have more experience in responding to these types of issues or directing their franchisees how to act, especially in industries (healthcare, service, etc.) with specific requirements above and beyond operating a business generally. By incorporating this broadly worded element in the new rule, Franchisors will be forced to revisit commonly incorporated contractual terms in their franchise agreements and will be reluctant to set operational standards related to health and safety to the detriment of their franchisees and the ultimate consumers., Finally, and most importantly, term and condition #5 (work rules and directions governing the manner, means, and methods of the performance of duties and the grounds for discipline) will create significant challenges when applied under the new standard. One of the critical components of every franchise system is the establishment of baseline standards designed to provide the consumer with the desired brand experience. The NLRB’s use of nebulous terms like “manner, means, and method” jeopardizes this cornerstone element of franchising by creating increased risk of joint employment exposure., In fact, the FTC’s Franchise Rule sets forth three definitional elements of a franchise, and one of those is that the franchisor “will exert or has the authority to exert a significant degree of control over the franchisee’s method of operation, or provide significant assistance in the franchisee’s method of operation.” The FTC therefore recognizes that this element is a natural and essential component of the franchise relationship; however, under the NLRB’s new rule you will be considered a joint employer if you reserve the right to control the manner, means, and methods of how day-to-day job functions are performed. This frustrating contradiction explains why the franchising community voiced strong opposition to this terminology through the issuance of comments in the rule making process, and underscores the conflict between the new rule and existing franchise law., The most significant change to the 2020 rule comes not from the list of terms and conditions of employment, but from the fact that a franchisor could be considered a joint employer even if they don’t actually exercise control related to these terms and conditions. Instead, the new standard will look at whether a franchisor has the authority to control the essential terms and conditions of employment (generally through reserved rights in the operations manual or franchise agreement)., A franchisor tasked with maintaining a uniform system that presents a certain image and level of quality to the public must inherently reserve a number of rights in its franchise agreement that it hopes never to exercise. Similarly, a franchisor’s operations manual must not only establish baseline standards to protect its brand, but also include the ability to take action against franchisees that do not maintain these standards and end up harming the image of the rest of the system. An inability to reserve these rights essentially prevents a franchisor from responding to the types of real-world problems that come up in the operation of nearly every type of business. To contrast, the 2020 rule looked at whether a franchisor exercised substantial direct control, which would be an indicator that a franchisor is actually stepping into the role of an employer by managing day-to-day operations as a regular course of business., Additionally, the new standard makes it clear that it applies to both direct and indirect control – from a franchising perspective, this removes the distinction between whether a franchisor directly controls the franchisee’s employees or whether it does so through the franchisee. While this poses less of a problem than the authority to control analysis described above, franchisors tasked with protecting the brand may have a legitimate need to respond to an isolated health and safety issue or another performance-related issue involving a franchisee’s employee. While such a response should be coordinated in tandem with the franchisee, the franchisor’s actions could still be construed as indirect control., For this reason, the 2020 rule specifically excluded control that is “only exercised on a sporadic, isolated, or de minimis basis.” With respect to franchising, this exclusion is entirely appropriate and necessary to ensure that a franchisor has the ability to step in when a serious issue has arisen that threatens the brand or system as a whole. However, this exclusion makes it clear that these types of interventions are reserved for isolated incidents rather than as an ordinary course of business, which correctly addresses the difference between a franchisor protecting their brand and an employer dictating the activities of its employees., As noted above, the new NLRB rule fails to address two critical components of a franchise system that are wholly independent from the legal definition of an employer-employee relationship: (1) brand uniformity and minimum system standards, and (2) compliance with industry-specific laws, regulations, and licensing requirements. By making it substantially more difficult for franchisors to protect these components, the new rule creates two possible negative consequences for franchisees., While several commenters, including the IFA, noted the importance of franchisors protecting their brands and their marks, it is clear that the NLRB failed to fully grasp the scope of what that entails. The new rule states that “many forms of control that franchisors reserve to protect their brands or trade service marks (like those dealing with logos, store design, décor, or product uniformity) will typically not be indicative of a common-law employment relationship.”, By essentially reducing a brand to a color scheme and a logo, the NLRB has ignored some of the most critical components of what makes a franchise system succeed. Yes, the actual mark is what is most visible to the public, but the standards behind that mark are what gives it value and what lets the public know what they can expect when they interact with any franchise in the system. Methods of operation, customer service, and proprietary processes are all components of a franchisor’s brand that they need the right to protect. In some industries, particularly service-focused industries without brick-and-mortar locations, these are arguably the most important components of the system to regulate., Instead, the NLRB is now creating a framework where a franchisor could be deemed an employer by reserving rights related to “the manner, means, and methods of the performance of duties. . .” – under this standard, protecting the brand will be a greater challenge, harming both the other franchisees that comprise the system as well as the general public., Though not as significant, a second area of concern relates to compliance with (often industry-specific) laws, regulations, and minimum licensing requirements. Franchising is a business model that cuts across nearly every industry that comprises the U.S. economy, and many franchisees are entrepreneurs that are first entering a new industry when they buy a franchise. While the vast majority of franchise agreements are structured so that franchisees are ultimately responsible for compliance with applicable laws and regulations, they understandably account for a level of support and guidance from franchisors., To that end, it is critical that franchisors be able to step in when there are compliance issues. This is essential for not only protecting the brand as described above, but also for protecting the consumers that are often the intended beneficiaries of these laws and regulations. While some issues do not impact the defined terms and conditions of employment, it is clear that many do (particularly with respect to the methods of performance and health and safety issues). Whether it involves licensed professions in the financial industry or workplace safety issues in the medical or home service industries, many franchisors have a legitimate need to reserve the right to ensure franchisees comply with relevant laws and regulations., If the rule takes effect in its current form, franchisors will essentially be stuck between a rock and a hard place. They can either accept the fact that they will be deemed a joint employer for collective bargaining purposes or they can modify their contracts, manuals, and operational practices to ensure that they do not meet the joint employer threshold under the new standard. Both of these would have negative consequences for franchisees., If a franchisor accepts its role a joint employer, the logical next step is to dramatically increase the amount of control over franchisee operations to minimize any labor-related issues with its newfound employees. This means less independence for franchisee operators and increased fees to defray what will likely be substantial costs for franchisors. On the other hand, a franchisor that does not wish to be deemed a joint employer will be less willing to provide operational direction, employee handbooks, or educational materials, reducing the level of support that franchisees receive., While the NLRB states that it is “mindful that applying the final rule will require sensitivity to industry-specific norms and practices,” the current version of the rule is drafted to avoid this level of nuance and relies on the courts to uniformly apply its broad standard without any additional guidance. For this reason and all of these reasons listed above, Congress should step in and prevent the rule from taking effect in its current iteration in order to avoid substantial harm to the franchising community and its consumers., Franchise Supplier Network is a community dedicated to helping franchisors and industry suppliers connect and grow.

Currently, companies have a real need to align the promises of advanced technology with their real-world, practical applications., Case Study: Leveraging A.I. to Keep Your Customers Happy, In a recent project with a B2C client, dbSeer harnessed the power of automation and artificial intelligence to revolutionize their operations. Automation and A.I. can significantly enhance productivity and streamline processes – if you understand how best to use it., When looking at their needs, we assessed that their Google Review management was a process that could be automated. Managing a growing number of reviews can be an overwhelming task for businesses. And yet, businesses that respond to just a single customer review earn 4% more revenue on average. However, 75% of businesses choose to not respond to their reviews. This is largely due to the time that it takes to respond, and other issues taking priority. Automation, however, can offer an effective solution to this problem., With the right tools, companies can now not only assess sentiment, but also craft personalized responses that aren’t a one-size-fits-all approach, all while remarkably reducing the time it takes., In our case, to efficiently manage this feedback, dbSeer developed a script powered by A.I. This script not only scanned through the reviews but also generated appropriate responses. To help improve the A.I.’s performance, our team categorized responses as positive or negative and even identified potential issues, such as pricing concerns or opportunities for additional product offerings to help further advance the responses and feedback. We then provided a sample to A.I. for further automated responses., Our team successfully processed 500 Google reviews, gaining valuable insights to help move our client forward. As an example, A.I. discerned that one review was made during a particularly cold November. This insight allowed us to craft a response that demonstrated our commitment to customer satisfaction during this season: truly providing a very personalized response to a cherished customer., Return on Investment, Online reputation is everything and the first thing a customer looks at is online reviews. 91% of 18- to 34-year-olds trust reviews online as much as personal recommendations – this clearly means that the importance managing these reviews should not be underestimated., According to one survey, 60% of consumers feel that the number of reviews a business has is a key indicator of whether or not they will use their services. The more, the better., But your employees shouldn’t spend their entire workday on customer reviews. A.I. and automation are critical to streamline this process. And by tracking metrics like customer retention, an increase in positive reviews (or reviews overall), and other key performance indicators, companies can gauge the value of automation in this process. Just the time saved by using this technology should be a measure of success!, Striking a Balance, dbSeer understands the importance of providing a human to bot balance. Customer reviews should still feel connected to your company’s mission and purpose. Automation’s role isn’t to replace human interactions but to enhance them. It streamlines processes, making them more efficient for customers, and employees alike: allowing for more ‘human work’ to be performed., As we integrate automation into our daily operations, upholding ethical business practices is a must. Striking the right balance between efficient technology and ethical considerations might involve discussions about transparency, data privacy, and the importance of maintaining a human touch in customer interactions., dbSeer can help your company find that balance, and continue to help grow a happy customer base.,  , dbSeer is a leading data analytics provider offering cutting-edge services to extract valuable insights from your data and drive growth. With experienced data scientists and industry insights, dbSeer empower businesses to make informed decisions and achieve lasting impact.

Even if you have a superior product or service that distinguishes your brand from the competition, and makes money, you still need to have great relationships with franchisees, vendors, the community, state regulators and customers to truly succeed., The Springboard 2023 Event gives you a fighting chance, by getting to you early, with industry best practices. You will receive valuable, actionable advice from experienced franchise founders who have been in your shoes, taken their lumps and went on to create successful franchise systems., The official agenda was just shared. Here’s a few of the sessions we’re looking forward to:,  , Cliff Hudson, former CEO & Chairman of the Board of SONIC Drive-In, will take Springboarders through his 35-year career in the franchise industry. Between the rise of third-party delivery, being acquired by Inspire Brands and the evolution of customer eating habits; Hudson will cover the gamut of his illustrious SONIC journey.,  , Tony Conza, founder of Blimpie, will share his incredible 59-year journey of growing his sandwich empire. Conza will detail the humble founding story of 3 New Jersey high school friends that channeled their love for freshly-sliced sandwiches to escape their dead-end jobs by opening their 1st Blimpie. Ever wonder who first introduced the “low-calorie” menu item, opened the 1st modern non-traditional franchise location, established an official franchisee advisory council or put “salad” on a sandwich? In this session, Conza will discuss how Blimpie’s innovative approach helped originate so many strategies we see in the modern Food & Beverage industry today; catapulting Blimpie to a peak of 2,000+ locations across North America.,  , In franchising, choosing the right technology suppliers early can make or break your brand. This session will cover the art of technology supplier selection, how to negotiate with a supplier properly, how to vet out if the technology is right for your brand at that given time and the right time to splurge or dive in the bargain bin.,  , Even as an emerging brand, it’s easy to see just how loud the franchise technology truly is. How do you even know where to start? In this breakout session, our panelists will guide you through the painstaking process of where to start your franchise technology journey, what type of technology to start with, what the hallmarks of a great technology for emerging brands looks like and how much you should generally be spending in the early years., Back by popular demand, Springboarders will have the opportunity to sit down and speak directly with founders/CEOs, banking executives, investment bankers and franchise platform companies to answer one major question: what is it like to go through a transaction in franchising? This is an opportunity unlike any other for attendees to learn firsthand about capital, the impetus for transactions, selecting a partner, organizing your affairs, and what to expect through integration and ongoing operations. This event will start with a brief panel followed by two, thirty-minute roundtable discussions.,  , Only a few spots left!

As most Franchisors see, their area of most concern is ‘growing the brand.’ Many franchisors focus on conference attendance, zee development & training, growth strategy, and rightfully so. Any good leader would promote that level of targeted investment of time and energy. As franchisors create sustainable growth through solid business fundamentals and process design, the brand generates momentum. When all the stars align, stratospheric heights can be achieved in relatively short periods of time. If your brand is growing, and at a blindingly fast speed, then so is the Owner’s risk. Risk management isn’t at the forefront of the franchisors’ mind, especially when it comes to early stage franchises. For so many reasons, insurance takes a back seat. As the brand cruises past 15 locations, many early insurance challenges start to surface. Then, before you know it, you have a burgeoning business. In many cases, the culture of risk management wasn’t created early on. Then the pain becomes very real., This happened to Scott Abott, the founder of 5 Star Franchising, a successful franchisor with multiple successful exits. His brand had an exposure to 3rd party contractor risks. One of the franchisees reported a subcontractor had fallen from a ladder, breaking their back. The subcontractor had an uninsured claim. The lawyers found the brand to be responsible for the claim in the amount of 5M. Yikes! This story is a recurring theme in our industry. The problem is unintentional exposure that puts the brand at risk. Franchisees with even the best intentions struggle with covering their business, let alone being FDD compliant. Franchisors are desperate for a real franchise solution., Rikor has established themselves as an expert in the franchise insurance space. They are positioned to help franchise brands create a culture of Risk Management with Franchisees. Many franchisors have failed to support an Insurance Compliance program in spite of varsity level efforts. If done right, there would be no time for the franchisor to focus on building the business. FDD compliance is too great of an ask, and the need for additional headcount would be inevitable. Rikor provides a very tangible service offering to offload the demand on administrators to push COI’s., Franchise Supplier Network is a community dedicated to helping franchisors and industry suppliers connect and grow.

It’s taking over many areas of business and entertainment, and as the technology continues to innovate, the benefits for your business will grow even larger. What can AI do for you and your franchise business? Franchise Supplier Network partner Ryan Hicks recently spoke about AI at UnConference, a conversation we’ll be continuing at Franchise Young Conference. Here are some of the highlights:, What is AI?, Artificial intelligence, or AI, combines large sets of data and massive computing power to identify patterns and make predictions. Newer versions are able to fully tailor the output to you with conversation history and memory. AI is smart enough to perform tasks that before now, only a human could complete., Why should I use AI?, First and foremost, AI is a huge timesaver. For example, there is generative AI (like ChatGPT) that creates things on a human-like level. This can be used to write copy and is smart enough to even understand the subject, tone, and more. Also, it is free, easy to use, and accessible to everyone on many levels. It can be beneficial for marketing and advertising to help you create content that consumers actually want to see. Lastly, it’s important to stay on top of the technology and societal changes in order to ensure your business is relevant., What are the drawbacks?, No, AI robots will not be taking over the world, but there are some important aspects to be aware of. Some platforms have outdated information and do not have knowledge past a certain year. It’s also important to note that free versions will be more simple than versions you have to pay for., How can it benefit my franchise?, As you input information, the AI learns and improves. With each task, it understands better and will get closer and closer to perfect. It acts as an all-encompassing, gold-star employee by saving time, creating content, and organizing information. In a business like franchising, where everything needs to be mass-communicated and implemented, AI brings an exciting new opportunity to automate and improve standard systems for your marketing, operations, recruiting, and in nearly every other area of your business., Interested in learning more about AI and how it’s changing the industry?

This is not only in line with behavior patterns observed in other business industries but is also following the trend of  technology evolution.  , Point solutions traditionally are designed with the intent to fix a specific problem that a  business faces with the necessary expertise and focus. While these solutions work well for  addressing a specific problem the existence of numerous point solutions, maintenance,  updates, support and management costs bring with them many additional challenges to  brands that impact their ability to grow and scale.  , Integrated platforms on the other hand address many of the challenges / concerns present  in technology stacks filled with single point solutions. As a single, flexible and customizable  platform that provides transparency, control, and accountability the benefits of a centralized  integrated platform have significant strategic and financial benefits. Additionally powerful  business specific solutions can be built on top of such centralized integrated platforms which  function as end-to-end operating system.  , Benefits of integrated solutions over point solutions: , Solution Management: Integrated platforms provide a unique customized solution that is  very specific to a brand that can consist of different point solutions orchestrated together to  address the brand needs. Point solutions on the other hand are only focused on solving a  particular problem without looking at the end-to-end business requirements.  , Support: As a brand grows and scales it’s franchise technology stack becomes more complex  as they need to not only address the many business requirements but also must support  their franchises. A technology strategy that revolves around multiple point solutions, to  address specific problems, without looking at the overall end-to-end business requirements  invariably brings with it challenges and costs associated with setup, configuration,  maintenance, troubleshooting etc. , Functionality & Scalability: Integrated platforms are inherently designed to be more flexible  to be able to add new functionality and features as brands grow and scale. This flexibility also  extends to the ability to upgrade or replace individual components of the tech stack. Point  solutions on the hand solve very specific problems and cannot typically add functionality  outside their specific solution and are not designed to support multiple integrations. The  flexibility provided by integrated  , Costs: Vendor management costs, individual subscription costs, training costs, API layer  maintenance and support costs all typically increase as the number of point solutions grow. Integrated solutions on the other hand, typically have a better cost structure as they able to  pass cost savings and economies of scale to their customers.  , As leaders in the management and implementation of the Franchise Tech Stack for brands,  using our orchestrated centralized platform, Maestro, we see this significant and inevitable  shift happing within the franchise industry as brands look to become more competitive,  profitable and increase market share., Franchise Supplier Network is a community dedicated to helping franchisors and industry suppliers connect and grow.

Several years ago, Cotti Foods found itself facing a significant challenge: the implementation of ASC 842. This accounting standard necessitated complex lease calculations, a task that CFO Scott Miller deemed burdensome and prone to error. Recognizing the need for a streamlined solution, Cotti Foods began exploring lease management systems to simplify this process and mitigate risk., After evaluating several options, Cotti Foods selected Leasecake as their lease and location management platform. The decision was driven by the system’s intuitive interface, robust features, and ability to standardize, simplify, and automate many of the back office real estate processes that were too time consuming for the team to handle manually while growing rapidly., Since adopting Leasecake two years ago, Cotti Foods has experienced tangible benefits across its real estate management operations., “Before Leasecake, we relied on landlords to prompt lease renewals, but now we’re proactive, controlling CPI calculations and ensuring accuracy,” said Scott Miller, CFO, Cotti Foods. “This technology has streamlined processes, giving us more control and reducing time to close leases.”, From simplifying ASC 842 compliance to empowering proactive lease negotiations, the platform has become an indispensable tool for driving efficiency, standardization, and scalability. With Leasecake, Cotti Foods is well-positioned to navigate the complexities of real estate management and continue its expansion with confidence., “We love Leasecake because it helps to reduce risk. We don’t miss lease options which can come back and bite us, because we know about them all ahead of time.” – Scott Miller, CFO, Cotti Foods , Let us show you how easy lease management can be. Get connected with Leasecake here!, Franchise Supplier Network is a community dedicated to helping franchisors and industry suppliers connect and grow.

Why the gap?, Unfortunately a lot of businesses are still using an antiquated data strategy. This limits their ability to gain meaningful, or at times, any, insight from their data. A lot of companies view technology as the challenge they need to solve rather than looking at it as a tool, and part of a larger up-to-date business strategy. If you’re interested in learning how to carry out a data strategy, check out our four-part series that breaks down how to design an effective data governance strategy., Data is capable of helping you see what’s working and what’s not with what’s most important in mind: your user, customer or client., Companies that leverage data reap the benefits. Even “small data” projects are critical. According to a report by Harvard Business Review, companies that opt to go small can still see a benefit of up to $250,000 on a project. Using your data is key to unlocking revenue potential by helping you understand your customer base., Making data driven decisions requires a very tailored approach to asking the right questions for your business to answer. Data can only be as good as the questions you ask., If you’re wanting to look at manufacturing productivity within the organization, you should be looking at the data that supports this. Once looking through the data: setting specific, tailored goals for your organization is key., A goal-oriented statement might look like:, “If we achieve a measurable 15% improvement in manufacturing productivity, as indicated by our Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) within the next six months, our aim is to strategically leverage these gains to realize a corresponding 10% reduction in operational costs, fostering increased business efficiency and sustainable cost optimization.”, If your problem is customer retention, you have to look at the data that corresponds to how your customers engage with your product., With this issue, a goal-oriented statement might look like:, “Over the next 12 months, our objective is to achieve a 10% improvement in customer retention, as measured by KPIs such as repeat purchase rates and customer satisfaction scores. By implementing targeted retention strategies, personalized customer engagement initiatives, and closely monitoring feedback, our aim is to fortify brand loyalty, enhance customer relationships, and ultimately contribute to a sustained increase in overall customer retention rates.”, Both of these statements set their companies up for success because:, The difference between a data-driven organization and one that isn’t is the specificity of the requirements put in their data aspirations., In addition to designing specific goals, data-driven organizations do not shy away from an innovative mindset. If their data indicates that their business strategy may need to course correct in order to meet these goals, they will. Data may lead a business to re-assess and find a new way of engaging with clients., Numbers don’t lie. Statistics show that if a business is data-centric, it is 58% more likely to exceed its revenue goals. Your data is key to unlocking next level potential in the market., dbSeer can help guide you on this journey, being widely recognized as the most trusted partner in the industry. Through its commitment to excellence and client-centric approach, dbSeer consistently delivers tangible outcomes and value to its clients, helping them achieve their goals and drive business success.
