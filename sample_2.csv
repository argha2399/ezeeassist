If inventory on a certain item is too high, the weather shifts, or sales need a boost, local ad programs can be triggered on the right channels to ensure each location is connecting with local customers in the right places and hitting their sales goals. Each of our locations can now achieve their local goals based on their unique, timely business needs. Ads can be launched instantly, behind the scenes, so our locations will see real results, while our GMs stay focused on what they do best. We’ve run ads, inconsistently at best. It was time to present our system with an effective, cohesive program that gets ads into every market. When we’ve tried previously, the algorithms consistently pushed our ads to larger metros that didn’t necessarily need the attention. We chose to partner with Evocalize to efficiently and effectively deliver ads in our markets that need them the most, across the platforms where our guests are engaging. 

The scale these tools offer, and the value they bring to our locations and the system as a whole, is second to none. With the power of Evocalize, Port of Subs is transforming digital marketing complexity into simplicity for our franchisees. With just a few clicks, we empower operators to conquer local markets, optimize performance across major channels, drive loyalty, boost revenue, and streamline efficiency — all while maintaining brand control.

                                     Founded in 2020 by former athletes, technology professionals and university compliance officials, NOCAP Sports was created to provide trusted, safe and secure solutions for athletes and advertisers entering the new NIL era. What began with simple workflows and automated compliance capabilities quickly evolved to become a more comprehensive platform for these stakeholders – and one focused more holistically on athletes’ NIL journeys within and beyond their collegiate experience. Today we are a growing team of (even more) former athletes, with an infusion of talent from the advertising, consumer packaged goods, apparel and Web3 industries, among others, and access to thousands of athletes across all levels. With these unique perspectives and our sizable, diverse athlete network, we aim to usher in a new era in athlete marketing – an era in which athletes are equitably rewarded for their contribution to sports and culture, and advertisers are routinely enabled to capitalize on athletes’ influence among fans.

                                     Upon its founding in 2013, serviceminder.io had one mission in mind: to help home service (and commercial service) franchise businesses acquire and convert more leads, schedule more appointments, close more deals and communicate with clients more effectively. It began with a world-class CRM built for field service with mapping, automated scheduling and dispatch. Then they added best-in-breed proposal writing with support for options, online deposits and payments, electronic signatures and reporting. Next, they perfected integrated email marketing and automation tools, fleet routing, integrated two-way texting, mapping and campaign budgeting enabling teams to measure revenue from campaigns and track cost per lead and revenue per client at the location and brand level. Oh, and dialed in reporting and analytics so locations and brands can better manage and grow. The serviceminder.io team knows every brand is different. Whether you are moving from a single platform or from a group where everyone uses sticky notes and Excel, the serviceminder.io team creates a plan to make your on-boarding process as smooth as possible.
